Search Script - Can enter a keyword into the text box which will use search_script.js to search movieObj.js file and send back returns where the keyword matches a word in a title of a movie. 


## Requirments for PWA

The technical requirements for PWA are web manifest file, be served using HTTPS, and must register a service worker with a fetch event handler.

## Installing

Can run on a local server such as Laragon to be able to serve over HTTPS.

Just drop the project into Largon root folder(www) and enable HTTPS.
